# Implementation-of-IQGAN-Robust-Quantum-GAN-for-Image-Synthesis-in-NISQ-Devices
This project implements IQGAN, a quantum Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed for image synthesis on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset to generate images of the digit '0'. IQGAN features a trainable multiqubit quantum encoder and a compact quantum generator that improves data synthesis quality while reducing hardware costs. Compared to previous quantum GAN approaches, IQGAN achieves better convergence, higher image fidelity, and efficient implementation on quantum simulators and real quantum processors.
